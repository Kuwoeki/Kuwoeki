### Hi there 👋 I'm Kuwoeki!

I'm a Computer Science student at WUNU, currently building a strong foundation in software and systems. My real passion, however, lies in **Cybersecurity**.

I'm actively diving into the **Offensive Security** side of things, turning theory into practice. My goal is to build a career in this field.

* 🌱 I'm currently building my practical skills on platforms like **TryHackMe**.
* 🇯🇵 I'm also combining this with my other passion, **learning Japanese (日本語)**, with the long-term goal of studying in Japan.
